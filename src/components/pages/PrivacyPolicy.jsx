                        once you've made a bill payment, you can't undo it to get a refund. Any wrong service information or service
                        numbers are not the responsibility of {props.domain}. However, if during a transaction you made on the
                        {props.domain} website, money was taken from your card or bank account and the bill payment was unsuccessful
                        within 24 hours of the transaction's completion, you must notify us by sending an email to the address
                        listed on the "Contact Us" page of the {props.domain} website. The Service Number, Operator Name, Bill Amount,
                        Transaction Date, Transaction ID, and Order Number should all be included in the email.
                        <br /> <br />
                        If {props.domain} determines that money was actually deducted from your card or bank account without a
                        successful online bill payment, the matter will be looked into, and you will receive a refund for the money
                        within 8 to 10 business days after the day we received your email. The amount will appear in your bank
                        account between 6 and 8 business days, depending on your bank's policy.
